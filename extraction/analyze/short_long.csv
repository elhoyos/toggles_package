"vital_uploads","ccnmtl/wardenclyffe",true,20,"OPS","long","VITAL is an external system that could be used for content publishing.

"enable_720p","ccnmtl/wardenclyffe",false,267,"OPS","long","The feature was introduced to support both 480 and 720 encoding options.

"enable_et_thumbs","ccnmtl/wardenclyffe",false,238,"OPS","short","Author in PR89 also indicates they are console logging the output of the operation in an external system (elastic transcoder) to 'figure out the format'. The switch is being used to reverse engineer the said format and the reason to have the 'waffle flag' is because of this uncertainty and the expected behavior of the feature in the application."

"DISABLE_ENGAGEMENT_EMAILS","CenterForOpenScience/osf.io",false,65,"OPS","short","Author says in PR8702 this is a 'feature' to temporarily disable a specific set of engagement emails.

In PR1902 author indicates the 'flag migration didn't seem appropriate since this will most likely be a temporary flag, so that can be created in the admin page when this is live'.

"show_engagement_forum_activity","edx/edx-analytics-dashboard",false,268,"RELEASE","long","On creation (PR82), author says the toggle is not 'intended to be long-lived and is only used in one location.'.
